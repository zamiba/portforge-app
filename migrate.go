// This file is a one-time migration of user data, not a compatibility layer.
// Nothing here is a fallback that PortForge keeps honouring: each function moves
// what it finds into the current arrangement, records that it has done so, and
// then does nothing on every subsequent launch. The whole file can be deleted
// once no installation predates it, and deleting it will change no behaviour for
// anyone already migrated.

// legacyTypeDirs maps every superseded ItemType directory name to its current
// one. A user's imported files live in folders named after these types, so a
// rename in the catalog strands whatever they have already imported.
//
// Three generations are covered because the names changed twice in three weeks:
// the original bare form, the short-lived *GameRom form, and the current
// [Platform][Medium][Form]. Several map onto one — PS1 dumps passed through both
// earlier spellings — which the merge below handles.
